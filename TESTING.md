## Code Validation
I have used the recommended HTML W3C Validator to validate all of my HTML files.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

* Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
* Right-click anywhere on the page, and select View Page Source (usually CTRL+U or âŒ˜+U on Mac).
* This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
* Copy everything, and use the validate by input method.
* Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated
