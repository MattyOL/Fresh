## Code Validation
I have used the recommended HTML W3C Validator to validate all of my HTML files in this project.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

* Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
* Right-click anywhere on the page, and select View Page Source (usually CTRL+U or âŒ˜+U on Mac).
* This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
* Copy everything, and use the validate by input method.
* Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated
