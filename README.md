## Future Features's

* ### Discount
  * In the future, I plan to implement a feature that enables me to generate discount codes. This will allow users to enjoy a 10% or 20% reduction in the prices of our offered products. These discount codes could be distributed through the newsletter using Mailchimp or be part of promotions on our marketing Facebook page. They might also be extended to new users joining the site or as a reward for our long-term customers.

* ### Return Item form
  * We provide the option for refunds and/or exchanges within the initial 30 days of your purchase. If this 30-day window has lapsed since your purchase, regrettably, we cannot offer any form of refund or exchange. It's imperative that the item remains unused and is returned in the same condition it was received for the eligibility of a refund or exchange.

## Ecommerce Business Model (B2C)
This e-commerce website operates on a simple Business-to-Customer (B2C) model, catering to individual customers. The focus is on individual transactions, and there are no subscription services involved. While still in its early development stages, the site already includes features like a newsletter and links for social media marketing.

The incorporation of social media is seen as an opportunity to build a community around the business and increase site visitor numbers, particularly by leveraging larger platforms like Facebook.

The newsletter serves as a valuable communication tool, allowing the business to regularly engage with site users. It can be used to share information about special offers, discountcodes, new inventory, updates to business hours, notifications of events, and other relevant updates.

Overall, this B2C e-commerce business is laying the groundwork for growth and customer engagement through strategic use of social media and a newsletter to keep users informed and connected with the brand.




## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects
This project utilized GitHub Projects as an Agile tool. Although not a dedicated tool, it was customized with appropriate tags, project creation, and issue assignments to fit the project's needs.

The tool was used to visualize the development progress of the project by mapping user stories onto a basic Kanban board. It enabled me to identify the work backlog and to move tasks across the board as they were being worked on, tested, and signed off upon completion.



## GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues served as an another Agile tool. There, I used my own User Story Template to manage user stories and created a Bug tag to track and monitor issues on the site to be worked on.

* [Open issues](https://github.com/MattyOL/Fresh-Vintage-P5-/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)




* [Closed issues ](https://github.com/MattyOL/Fresh-Vintage-P5-/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)




### MoSCoW Prioritization
Prior to prioritizing and implementing the Epics, I broke them down into smaller stories using a decomposition approach. This method enabled me to apply the MoSCoW prioritization and labels to the individual user stories within the Issues tab

* **Must have** = Guaranteed delivery.
* **Could have** =  has small impact if left out.
* **Bug** 
* **Enhancement** = To make to site more user friendly.

## Testing 
For all testing, please refer to the [Testing.md](https://github.com/MattyOL/Fresh-Vintage-P5-/blob/main/README.md) file.

# Amazon AWS

This project utilizes AWS to store media and static files in the cloud since Heroku does not support persistent storage for this type of data.

After creating your AWS account and logging in, proceed with the following steps to establish the connection for your project. Ensure that you are on the AWS Management Console page:

1. Create an AWS account and log in.
2. Access the AWS Management Console page.
3. Follow this series of steps to establish the connection for your project.

## SE Bucket

1. Search for S3.
2. Click on "Create Bucket" to start the process of creating a new bucket.
3. From Object Ownership, make sure to have ACLs enabled, and Bucket owner preferred selected.
4. Uncheck Block all public access, and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for it to work on Heroku).
5. om the Properties tab, turn on static website hosting, and type index.html and error.html in their respective fields, then click Save.
6. Give your new bucket a name that matches your Heroku app name. For example, if your Heroku app is called "my-awesome-app," you can name your bucket "my-awesome-app" as well.
7. From the Permissions tab, paste in the following CORS configuration:

1. Before finalizing, append "/*" to the Resource key within the Bucket Policy Editor (as shown above) before clicking on "Save."

2. Click Save.

3. Proceed to the Access Control List (ACL) section, select "Edit," and enable the "List" option for Everyone (public access). Confirm your action by accepting the warning box.

4. If the "Edit" button is disabled, you should navigate to the "Object Ownership" section mentioned earlier and enable ACLs (Access Control Lists) from there. Once ACLs are enabled, you can go back to the Access Control List (ACL) section, and the "Edit" button should now be available for you to make the necessary changes.

# IAM 
Upon returning to the AWS Services Menu, locate and access IAM (Identity and Access Management). After reaching the IAM page, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Users" section and click on "Add user" to create a new IAM user.
2. Specify the desired username for the new IAM user.
3. Choose the access type - "Programmatic access" (for API and CLI access) and/or "AWS Management Console access" (for web-based console access).
4. Set permissions for the IAM user. You can either add the user to an existing IAM group with predefined policies or attach policies directly to the user.
5. Optionally, configure tags for the IAM user for better organization and identification.
6. Review the user's settings and permissions to ensure they are accurate.
7. Click on "Create user" to finalize the creation of the new IAM user.
8. Remember to securely save the access credentials (e.g., Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) if you selected "Programmatic access" to avoid any accidental exposure.
9. From the JSON tab, select the Import Managed Policy link.
 ** Search for S3, select the AmazonS3FullAccess policy, and then Import.

 ** You'll need your ARN from the S3 Bucket copied again, which is pasted into "Resources" key on the Policy.




Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS), was employed for this project. This cloud-based platform enables developers to build, run, and manage applications entirely on the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

* Select New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
* Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select Create App.
* From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars, and set your environment variables.

1. CLOUDINARY_URL - 	insert your own Cloudinary API key here
2. DATABASE_URL - insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here
3. DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC - 1 (this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment)
4. SECRET_KEY - this can be any random secret key

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

* requirements.txt
* Procfile
You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:

* pip3 install -r requirements.txt
If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

* pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
The Procfile can be created with the following command:

* echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
* replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located
For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

* Select Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app / You Can also Manual deploy.

Or:

* In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
* Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a app_name (replace app_name with your app name)
* After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type:
* git push heroku main

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku & everything should deploy correctly!

 # local Deployment 
This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the requirements.txt file.

* pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
You will need to create a new file called env.py at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample env.py file:
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "insert your own Cloudinary API key here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "this can be any random secret key")


Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

* Start the Django app: python3 manage.py runserver
* Stop the app once it's loaded: CTRL+C or ⌘+C (Mac)
* Make any necessary migrations: python3 manage.py makemigrations
* Migrate the data to the database: python3 manage.py migrate
* Create a superuser: python3 manage.py createsuperuser
* Load fixtures (if applicable): python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json (repeat for each file)
* Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: python3 manage.py runserver

## Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the ur Github repository
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
7. git clone 
8. Press Enter to create your local clone.

## Forking

To avoid affecting the original owner's repository, a copy of the original repository is made on our GitHub account by forking the GitHub Repository. This enables us to view and/or make changes without modifying the original repository. The following steps can be used to fork this repository:

 1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository 

 2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.

 3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
